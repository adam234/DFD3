# DFD3
<ol>
<li>It uses 5 symbols.  A rectangle represents an external entity, a person or code outside your control.  A rounded rectangle represents a process. They're connected by arrows, which can be single or double headed.  Data stores are represented by parallel lines.  A trust boundary is a closed shape, usually a box.  All lines are solid, except those used for trust boundaries, which are dashed or dotted.  (There is no "multi-process" symbol in DFD3.)
<li>It must not* depend on the use of color, but can use color for additional information.
<li>All elements should have a label.
<li>You may have a context diagram if the system is complex.  One is not required.
</ol>
* Must, must not, should, should not are used per IETF norms.
