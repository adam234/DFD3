# DFD3

## Definition
1. A V3 DFD uses 5 symbols.  A rectangle represents an external entity, a person or code outside your control.  A rounded rectangle represents a process. They're connected by arrows, which can be single or double headed.  Data stores are represented by parallel lines.  A trust boundary is a closed shape, usually a box.  All lines are solid, except those used for trust boundaries, which are dashed or dotted.  (There is no "multi-process" symbol in DFD3.)
2. It must not* depend on the use of color, but can use color for additional information.
3. All elements should have a label.
4. You may have a context diagram if the system is complex.  One is not required.
</ol>
* Must, must not, should, should not are used per IETF norms.

## Goal
Many people have presented various different ways to craft data flow diagrams over the years.  This is an attempt to be more precise.
